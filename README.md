# CS231N

This repo is to consolidate material that we covered as part of Stanford University's course [CS231N : Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/index.html) . I took this course in Spring 2017.

[assignments_details](assignments_details) contains the raw folders that were worked on as part of the assignment. [assignments_submittedzips](assignments_submittedzips) has the zips of the submissions only. [assignments_unsolved](assignments_unsolved) has the unsolved assignments.

For final project, take a look at [DeepDish](https://github.com/abgoswam/deepdish), where we used CNNs for identifying food dishes.
